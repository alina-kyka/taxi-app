## Deliverables

- Project Source code.
- SQL scripts used for creating the database and tables. - Find in `TaxiApp/TaxiApp.Infrastructure/Migrations`
- Number of rows in your table after running the program. - Amount of rows inserted into db `29889`.
- Any comments on any assumptions made. - It is assumed that if `passenger_count` is empty in .csv that means `passenger_count=0`
